# Twitchify 


Twitchify is a Python library that unites Twitch's WebSocket EventSub and Helix API, seamlessly providing real-time event notifications and facilitating Helix API utilization.



## Features

- Real-time Twitch event notifications through WebSocket EventSub.
- Helix API support with user access token for broader Twitch functionality.
- Built-in support for type hinting, ensuring code clarity and maintainability.

## Why Twitchify?

Twitchify is user-centric, perfect for self-use and hassle-free Twitch event setup. Unlike other libraries with multiple tokens, Twitchify prioritizes simplicity by using a single user access token.

Developers can create Twitch apps effortlessly, as Twitchify seamlessly integrates WebSocket EventSub and Helix API. With real-time event notifications and built-in authentication, event handling is a breeze.
